# 🍂 First Independent Project: Autumn Lover's Page

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my **Autumn Lover's** page — a personal project built to apply and showcase the skills I've learned through the **Per Scholas Software Engineering** course.

This project marks my first step into independent development, with the goal of building something seasonal, creative, and cozy for all the autumn enthusiasts out there. 🍁

This project serves as:
- A practice platform for applying front-end development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- A seasonal-themed webpage to express creativity using visual design tools and coding.
- A foundation to build on for future independent or collaborative projects.

## 🌟 Features
- 🎃 Autumn-themed design
- 🍁 Seasonal images, videos, or animations
- 🍂 Clean and responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- 🔗 Useful seasonal links or resources

> Note: As this is an in-progress learning project, features may change or expand over time.
